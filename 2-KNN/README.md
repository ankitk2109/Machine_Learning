# KNN

KNN Algorithm is based on feature similarity: How closely out-of-sample features resemble our training set determines how we classify a given data point.

Following tasks are performed in above code for KNN:
1. Reading CSV
2. Applying KNN to the dataset
3. Finding nearest neighbour for a query record
4. plot the dataset:
